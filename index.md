# Ramana Nagasamudram

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science department at [Stevens
Institute of
Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/school-engineering-science/departments/computer-science),
advised by [Dave Naumann](https://dnaumann.github.io) and [Anindya Banerjee](https://software.imdea.org/~ab/).
I'm part of the [Cypress](https://mgree.github.io/cypress) research group.

## Research

I work on software verification of **relational properties**.
Computer programs evolve constantly.  It's challenging to obtain
strong guarantees that code revisions preserve intended behaviors,
especially in the absence of precise functional specifications.  My
research addresses this problem by building tools and techniques for
*verifying* relations, such as equivalence and refinement, between
programs.  The goal is to formally account for code updates,
bug-fixes, optimizations, etc., in the simplest possible manner.
